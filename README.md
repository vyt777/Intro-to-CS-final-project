# Intro-to-CS-final-project
This is the final project of "Intro to Computer Science" course (https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-computer-science--cs101). In this project my code parses strings, creates data structure to store data from strings, changes data and solves problem of Depth-first search, searching the path from one node of graph (created data structure) to another. I took theoretic description of search in graph from «Introduction to algorithms» book (by Thomas H. Cormen and colleagues) and implement it in my code. Searching algorithm implements recursion, uses loop count to prevent infinite loop and also uses a few states of each node (not visited, visited at least once or more, explored).
